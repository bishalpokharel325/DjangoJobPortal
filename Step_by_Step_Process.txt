STEP 2: Lets Start Coding:
	i) Creating Virutal environment, creating django project named "MainHub" and pushing it in repository
	ii) cd MainHub and then py manage.py migrate in the terminal
	iii) py manage.py runserver .. 
	iv) go to /admin ... the best thing about django is that it has built in admin panel.
	v) create superuser in another terminal
	vi) login in into admin panel .. you will see new user there

STEP-3: Add a Client:

	i) Add user in admin panel
	ii) say domino... 
	iii) tick checkbox if domino can login to admin site : staff status tick mark
	iv) open incognito window and try to login into client side //// so we fulfilled first object of client being able to login into admin site page

STEP-4: Create New Database for Job:
	i) Before creatin model in django we must first create app. there are various apps in the project for modular application. reuse any app if needed
	ii) So, How many models we need? lets look into the data reqirements. we already taken care of admin and client .. now we need Candidates and Jobs
	iii) lets make two apps: one for candidates and one for jobs .. first of all create jobs app
	iv) create class for jobs adding 5 above columns and then register in setting.py
	v) in addition to various 5 colums we also rrquire creator. which client created the job openeing???
		creator=models.ForeignKey(User,on_delete=models.CASCADE) 
	vi) tell python to create a table using makemigration and migrate
	vii) register the model in admin.py and also prepopulate with user

		exclude=['creator',]
		 def save_model(self, request, obj, form, change):
	 	        obj.creator = request.user
			obj.save()
	viii) create some jobs and test them.
	ix) Client Should not be able to see the creater of jobs:
		make list_display as a function .. define it as get_list_display
		

STEP-5: Create New DataBase for Candidates.
